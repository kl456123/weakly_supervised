# weakly_supervised

 understand CNN by using weakly supervised learning .
here we just reverse infomation by top-down way to find its source.
In the process, we can filter some low value to reduce the computation
and get rid of some noise.

 note that many method of top-down are just different in the way of filter noise
so the key is to find the best way to make the real infomation to preserve and ignore the noise.
I think it is also the truth of processing infomation for CNN(or all NN)
